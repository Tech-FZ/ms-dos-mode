# MS-DOS Mode

MS-DOS mode bought back into Windows!

# The Story

As you might know, Windows 1.01, Windows 95, and Windows 98 had MS-DOS mode.

However, it was discontinued later.

Just for fun, though, I have decided to make Windows boot into the Command Prompt when you log in!

# How to Use

_Add later..._
